# Interview Scheduler

Scheduler has been built using React and can schedule appointments for students and interviewers. The user is able to make, edit and delete appointments as they require and they can select the interviewer of their choice for a specific day.

This full stack web application is a project that has been built in a modular fashion using Storybook for each component and the testing has been completed with Jest and Cypress. PostgreSQL has been used for the data storage and transfers between the client and server are done with axios.
